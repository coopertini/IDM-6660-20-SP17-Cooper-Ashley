				<h2>Catching Fire</h2>

				<img class="main-pub" src="image/catching-fire-cover.jpg" alt="Catching-Fire Book Cover Image">

				<p class="preview">Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying. (Scholastic Press, 2009)</p>

				<h3>Featured Review</h3>

				<quote class="review">“Whereas Katniss kills with finesse, Collins writes with raw power...The Hunger Games and Catching Fire expose children to exactly the kind of violence we usually shield them from. But that just goes to show how much adults forget about what it's like to be a child. Kids are physical creatures, and they're not stupid. They know all about violence and power and raw emotions. What's really scary is when adults pretend that such things don't exist."</quote>

				<h2>The Hunger Games</h2>

				<img class="main-pub" src="image/hunger-games-cover.jpg" alt="The Hunger Games Book Cover Image">

				<p class="preview">Katniss is a 16-year-old girl living with her mother and younger sister in the poorest district of Panem, the remains of what used be North America. Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol and were defeated. As part of the surrender terms, each district agreed to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual televised event called, "The Hunger Games." The terrain, rules, and level of audience participation may change but one thing is constant: kill or be killed. When her sister is chosen by lottery, Katniss steps up to go in her place.

				<h2>Gregor and the Code of Claw</h2>

				<img class="main-pub" src="image/gregor-code-claw-cover.jpg" alt="Gregor and the Code of Claw Book Cover Image">

				<p class="preview">Everyone in the Underland has been taking great pains to keep The Prophecy of Time from Gregor. Gregor knows it must say something awful but he never imagined just how awful: It calls for the warrior's death. Now, with an army of rats approaching, and his mom and sister still in Regalia, Gregor the warrior must gather up his courage to help defend Regalia and get his family home safely. The entire existence of the Underland is in Gregor's hands, and time is running out. There is a code to be cracked, a mysterious new princess, Gregor's burgeoning dark side, and a war to end all wars. (Scholastic Press, 2007)</p>

				<hr/>

				<h3>Featured Review</h3>

				<quote class="review">"Perhaps Collins’s greatest achievement in these tales is the effortless introduction of weighty geopolitical ethics into rip-roaring adventure. It seems as elusive in the Underland as up above, but Gregor and his companions, including the unforgettable rat Ripred, may yet find a way. The resolution is bittersweet but faintly hopeful—a fitting end for an unflinchingly gutsy series whose deftly drawn characters have always lived dangerously."</quote>

				<h2>When Charlie McButton Lost Power</h2>

				<img class="main-pub" src="image/charlie-mcbutton-cover.jpg" alt="When Charlie McButton Lost Power Book Cover Image">

				<p class="preview">When a thunderstorm knocks out the electricity, Charlie McButton's whole tech empire comes tumbling down. He needs batteries–FAST. But the only batteries are inside his baby sister's beloved talking doll. Will he resort to desperate measures, and cause his sister to have a meltdown of her own? Or will he snap out of his computer craze long enough to realize sisters can be fun, even without batteries? (Penguin Group, 2005)</p>

				<p class="read-more"><a href="#">More about the book ></a></p>

				<hr/>

				<h3>Featured Review</h3>

				<quote class="review">"A clever, humorous story in rhyme. Charlie's techno-driven world comes to a crashing halt when a thunderstorm causes a power outage. His mother advises, "You'll have to find something without plugs to play./​Read a book!/​Clean your room!/​Sing a song!/​Model clay!" Uninspired, Charlie finally remembers an old handheld video game, but the battery is missing. Desperate, he steals one from his sister's talking doll and ends up in the time-out chair. Feeling remorseful when the little girl starts crying, he seeks her out and the two have a grand time playing games and pretending to be dragons and wizards. When the power returns, Charlie is ready to retreat to his "handsets and bots" but decides that it might be fun to spend some time with his sister as well. The hilarious cartoon illustrations are bold and appealing and depict the siblings' many emotions with exaggerated clarity. While the mother appears only as a hand patting her panicked son's head, the family dog is usually present, patiently enduring a hose-down from little Isabel Jane or angrily reproving Charlie for hurting her feelings. Pair this tale with Glenn McCoy's Penny Lee and Her TV (Hyperion, 2002) for a fun storytime during 'TV Turnoff Week.'"</quote>
